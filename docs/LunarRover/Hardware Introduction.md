# LunarBot Hardware Introduction
LunarBot is the **fundamental** unit of a lunar service robot cluster. 

The LunarBot is built on a **4-wheeled independent steering and driving platform**, each wheel features a driving motor and steering motor with encoders. It is equipped with a multi-modal perception system that integrates a Livox-Mid360 360Â° LiDAR, a Intel Realsense D435i camera and IMU integrated in it. Realman RM-75, a 7-degrees-of-freedom (7-DOF) robotic manipulator, with a 2-finger gripper as end effector, is also integrated.

## Geometric Information

The rover is approximetly 1300mm length, 1000mm width and 800mm height without solar pannels and manipulator. All wheels' $\Phi= 260mm $ (without EVA foam) and $width = 168mm$.

## Components

Current LunarBot is a 4 wheel model.

### Wheels

Each wheels is equipped with: 

  * A 100 Watts steering motor with encoder
  * A 200 Watts driving motor with encoder
  * 1 origin indicator sensor (npn switch)
  * 1 limitaion indicator sensor (npn switch)
  * 2 servos, for each motor
  * Steering and driving motor gear box

Except servos are installed in chassis body, all other components are exposed at each wheel.

### Chamber

Inside the chamber of the chassis, we got:

  * A high-voltage graphene power cell
  * A low-voltage graphene power cell
  * 8 servos
  * Circuit breakers
  * Computation Module

### Sensors

  * Livox-Mid360 LiDAR
  * Intel Realsense D435i Camera
  * IMU

### Manipulators

  * Realman RM-75 robot manipupator, 7-dof
  * Inspire Robots EG2-4C gripper
